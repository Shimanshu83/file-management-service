Objective of file management api is to :- 
1. Upload , list , delete API's. 
2. File categorization functionality ( need to do research on this what the heck is this ). 



File categorization. 

Here we can categorize file based on file extension name such as 

if (['jpg', 'png', 'gif'].includes(ext)) {
    return 'images';
  } else if (['pdf', 'doc', 'docx'].includes(ext)) {
    return 'documents';
  } else {
    return 'others';
  }

based on file size :- 

small : below 10 mb 
medium : below 100mb 
nad large : above 1000mb 



In this case we need to save the metadata of the file in the rows so it will be 
helpful for us to deferentiate and categorize it on the basis of the file. 


// need to check on the below functionality if it's working or not. 
**Optimization:**

- Implement file upload and deletion efficiently. use stream for this because this is the only way to upload things faster without blocking thread
- Minimize unnecessary code execution.
- Utilize async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Utilize caching mechanisms for improved performance.
- Handle errors gracefully. understood. 

**Responsibility Division:**

- Divide the application into well-defined and reusable modules. understood. 
- Implement SOLID principles for better maintainability. need to understand it in deep 
- Use Dependency Injection for loose coupling. I know this.
